There are three types of topic:

                    1ยบ. Broadcast: All stations within range will receive and process the message
                    2ยบ. Constellation_X: directed to all the membern that belong to a certain constellation
                    3ยบ. Station_X: directed to a specific staion 





This will be the default arquitecture of the payload inside the mqtt message directed to the stations:



{
  "topic": "",

  "msg_type": "",
  
  "message": {

      }
}
    


Within each type of topic we will define different types of messages.
