There are three types of topic:

                    1º. Broadcast: All stations within range will receive and process the message
                    2º. Constellation_X: directed to all the membern that belong to a certain constellation
                    3º. Station_X: directed to a specific staion 





This will be the default arquitecture of the payload inside the mqtt message directed to the stations:



{
  "msg_type": "",

  "message": {

      },
}

This is the model that the messages, that intend to change the parameters, have to follow: 

                              "message": {
                                "name": "Measurement 1",
                                "freqIni": 1000,
                                "freqFinal": 2000,
                                "threshold": "high",
                                "t_capt": 10,
                                "chanBW": 20,
                                "nfft": 1024,
                                "mode": "continuous"
                              }

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!HERE WE SHOULD DEFINE WHAT EACH PARAMATER DOES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Within each type of topic we will define different message types.



==========================> Broadcast <==========================

topic = "broadcast"

==> Types of messages

  1º ===> msg_type = "0" : Stations within reach will start measuring with the default parameters. The message field will be ignored

  2º ===> msg_type = "1" : Stations within reach will start measuring with the parameters defined in the message field

  3º ===> msg_type = "2" : Stations within reach will stop measuring. The message field will be ignored

  4º ===> msg_type = "3" : Stations within reach will join the specified constellation. This means that all that receive this message will adopt this as their new constellation, even if they already had one. 

  "message": {
      "constellation" : "x"
  }

  5º ===> msg_type = "4" : Stations within reach will change their default measuring parameters. The message field will be the same as the msg_type = "1"

  ======================> Constellation_X <======================
  
  topic = "constellation_x"

  ==> Types of messages

  1º ===> msg_type = "0" : Stations within reach, that belong to the constellation, will start measuring with the defaul parameters. The message field will be ignored

  2º ===> msg_type = "1" : Stations within reach, that belong to the constellation, will start measuring with the parameters defined in the message field

  3º ===> msg_type = "2" : Stations within reach, that belong to the constellation, will stop measuring. The message field will be ignored

  4º ===> msg_type = "3" : Stations within reach, that belong to the constellation, will join the specified constellation. This means that they will leave their current constellation and join the new one.

  "message": {
      "constellation" : "x"
  }

  5º ===> msg_type = "4" : Stations within reach, that belong to the constellation, will change their default measuring parameters. The message field will be the same as the msg_type = "1"

  ==========================> Station_X <==========================

  topic = "station_x"
  
  ==> Types of messages
  
    1º ===> msg_type = "0" : The station will start measuring with the defaul parameters. The message field will be ignored
  
    2º ===> msg_type = "1" : The station will start measuring with the parameters defined in the message field
  
    3º ===> msg_type = "2" : The station will stop measuring. The message field will be ignored
  
    4º ===> msg_type = "3" : The station will join the specified constellation. This means that if the station already had one, it will forgone the past one for the new one. 
  
    "message": {
        "constellation" : "x"
    }

    5º ===> msg_type = "4" : The station will change their default measuring parameters. The message field will be the same as the msg_type = "1"
